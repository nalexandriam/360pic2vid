# 360pic2vid
NodeJS app to convert pictures into video using ffmpeg

the pictures in the 'input_videos' folder are converted in videos of 30 seconds(change in the code the time you want)
in the 'input_videos' folder there is a powershell script to 'clean' the names of the files removing parentesis and replacing with '0' zeros, so the convert.js can work with no problem.
A shell alternative is also included.

YOU NEED ffmpeg  INSTALLED!!
